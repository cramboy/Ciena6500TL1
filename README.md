# Ciena 6500 TL1
## Repository of pre-built TL1 commands for faster creation of custom Python 3 scripts and programs run on Ciena OME6500 ROADM and FOADM devices

This project is a series of Python3 modules used to login to and run TL1 commands (specifically) on Ciena OME6500 DWDM ROADM and FOADM devices. Commands are verified for Software Release REL10.00, REL11.20, and REL12.60. These commands have NOT been verified on other DWDM configurations (TOADM, COADM, Submarine, etc.)
