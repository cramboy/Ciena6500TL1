# Ciena 6500 TL1
## Repository of pre-built TL1 commands for faster creation of custom Python 3 scripts and programs run on Ciena OME6500 ROADM and FOADM devices

CienaTL1 is a module used to run TL1 commands (specifically) on Ciena OME6500 DWDM ROADM and FOADM devices. Commands are verified for Software Release REL10.00, REL11.20, and REL12.60. These commands have NOT been verified on other DWDM configurations (TOADM, COADM, Submarine, etc.)

TL1 (Transaction Language 1) is an ancient and mysterious command line syntax used to speak directly to telecom devices in "the old tongue". Possibly alien in origin, this language is believed to have been used in shadowy druid cults attempting to gain favor with the dark telco underlord. Don't stare at it for too long
